Slack pipeline library for [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io), enabling seamless integration of Slack services into your workflows.

## Documentation

- **[Pipelines →](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/slack/pipelines)**

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

### Connections

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `SLACK_TOKEN`

You can also create `connection` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/slack.fpc
```

```hcl
connection "slack" "slack_conn" {
  token = "xoxp-12345-..."
}
```

For more information on connections in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Connections](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/connections).

### Usage

[Initialize a mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/index#initializing-a-mod):

```sh
mkdir my_mod
cd my_mod
flowpipe mod init
```

[Install the Slack mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies) as a dependency:

```sh
flowpipe mod install github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-slack
```

[Use the dependency](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/write-pipelines/index) in a pipeline step:

```sh
vi my_pipeline.fp
```

```hcl
pipeline "my_pipeline" {

  step "pipeline" "post_message" {
    pipeline = slack.pipeline.post_message
    args = {
      channel = "test"
      text    = "Hello World"
    }
  }
}
```

[Run the pipeline](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/pipelines):

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run my_pipeline
```

### Developing

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-slack.git
cd flowpipe-mod-slack
```

List pipelines:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline list
```

Run a pipeline:

```shell
flowpipe pipeline run post_message --arg channel=test --arg text="Hello World"
```

To use a specific `connection`, specify the `conn` pipeline argument:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run post_message --arg channel=test --arg text="Hello World" --arg conn=connection.slack.my_conn
```
